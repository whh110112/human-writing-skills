# Physical Continuity

This guide prevents character teleportation, seat drift, clothing drift, and prop inconsistency in long scenes.

Use it for cars, trains, elevators, booths, bedrooms, hospital rooms, offices, motorcycles, airplanes, dining rooms, stools, beds, floors, and any physical scene where position or capacity matters.

## Recommended Command

Before generation:

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli build `
  --style fiction `
  --strict-continuity `
  --review `
  --context examples/vehicle-scene-ledger.md `
  --task "Continue the car argument. Every seat change must have an on-page transition. Keep clothing and props consistent."
```

After a draft already exists:

```powershell
python -m humanwriting.cli audit `
  --draft examples/problem-car-scene-draft.md `
  --context examples/vehicle-scene-ledger.md
```

`--strict-continuity` automatically adds:

- `spatial-blocking`
- `occupancy-capacity`
- `appearance-prop-continuity`
- `physical-continuity-audit`

## What To Track

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Position | driver seat, front passenger seat, rear-left, rear-right |
| Physical resource | seat, bench, bed, stool, table, aisle, floor, motorcycle saddle |
| Mode | one-person seat, shared bench, folded bed, standing surface, storage, blocked |
| Capacity rule | one adult, shared surface, unknown, temporary standing, load-limited |
| Facing | forward, toward window, through mirror |
| Reach | wheel, glove box, door handle, nearby person |
| Obstacles | seat belt, console, table, doorway, front seat back |
| Movement gate | stops car, unbuckles, opens door, climbs out, squeezes past |
| Appearance | skirt length, shoes, coat, hair, makeup, injuries |
| Props | phone, bag, letter, weapon, keys, umbrella |

## Rule

If no transition is written, the previous physical state remains true.

If no transformation is written, the resource keeps its previous mode and capacity.

Those two rules prevent most seat drift, over-occupancy, clothing drift, and object drift.

## Why Use `audit`

`build --strict-continuity` is a generation guard. It helps before drafting, but a model may still miss contradictions when reviewing an existing passage.

The `audit` command creates a forensic review prompt. It forces evidence extraction before judgment, then checks:

- front/rear seat drift
- occupancy and capacity conflicts
- barriers such as soundproof glass or partitions
- impossible reach, touch, handoff, or direct whispering
- shoes, skirt length, coat, injury, and prop drift
- missing movement gates such as stopping, unbuckling, opening a door, or changing seats
- missing transformation gates such as folding seats into a bed, clearing a table, or turning a stool into a standing platform
