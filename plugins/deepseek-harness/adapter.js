Use for requested output >=10,000 characters or words, or explicit multi-agent long-form writing,
not merely a long input or an ordinary long-form audit. Preserve the requested length unit.
Save the agreed outline through normal workspace tools; do not invent missing user facts.
Call ${tool('plan_long_form_writing')}(outline_path, output_dir, style, target_length,
chunk_size=5000, length_unit='characters'|'words', execution_mode='sequential', max_parallel=4,
context_paths?, source_paths?, reference_paths?). Context is project truth, sources are factual
evidence, references are voice only. All paths stay inside the configured writing root.

Order: outline checker -> chunk planner -> writer per chunk -> separate editor per chunk ->
final continuity reviewer -> assemble. IDs: outline-check -> chunk-plan -> write-0001 /
review-0001 pairs -> continuity. Call ${tool('list_writing_tasks')}(package_dir);
claim only ready tasks via ${tool('claim_writing_task')}(package_dir, task_id, agent_id).
The claim returns content (complete role-specific prompt) and result_schema: forward both
unchanged, never substitute a generic role prompt. Keep the claim's agent_id through
${tool('submit_writing_result')}(package_dir, task_id, result: object, agent_id).
Forward the full content, result_schema, and claim_token unchanged to the assigned role.
The submitted result.claim_token must copy the current claim_token, also supplied in
result_schema.claim_token. Track child ID, task ID, agent_id, and claim_token together.
An active same-agent resume keeps its token; a reclaim or revision attempt gets a new token.
Reject stale child results from an earlier attempt; never relabel them with a new token.
Use distinct writer/editor identities; retain each identity on bounded revision attempts.
The final reviewer must differ from all chunk writers.

If the host exposes a native delegation tool, use its advertised schema (DSH normally uses
subagent with description and prompt; toolName is configurable). DSH requires dsh-subagent,
a configured provider such as dsh-subagent-spawn-in-process, and dsh-tool-subagent; the service
or MCP alone is not an agent runner. A native start returns a child ID, NOT completed prose.
Map that child ID to the claimed agent_id, wait for its completion notice, then submit the
actual structured result unchanged. Never fabricate receipts or count a start as approval.
Do not assume a fresh child inherits conversation; forward the full claim and schema.
If delegation is absent, denied, or fails, disclose the limitation. Use honest sequential
distinct role passes, with role-pass identities rather than invented child IDs; explicitly
say they are not independent agents. Do not silently reassign an already claimed task.

After each submission, re-list readiness. Fix requests permit only the bounded revisions
allowed by the returned protocol. Stop and report exhausted or blocked work; do not bypass
approval or edit package state. Later tasks stay blocked until their predecessor is approved.
Parallel work is permitted ONLY in execution_mode='contract' with approved explicit independent
block entry/exit contracts, and only for ready tasks up to max_parallel and host capacity.
max_parallel bounds simultaneous claims, not guaranteed agent processes. 60000/5000 means
12 writing jobs plus their review jobs, not 12 guaranteed concurrent agents.
Otherwise run sequentially, even if the host suggests parallel independent delegation.
After all required approvals, call ${tool('verify_writing_project')}(package_dir), then
${tool('assemble_writing_project')}(package_dir, output_path). Never claim completion on
failed verification or assembly, and never publish externally without user instruction.`

For novels use fiction/webnovel; for papers academic-paper; for reports formal-document;
for news news-report; for essays argumentative; for posts self-media. Respect the user's language.
For requested output >=10,000 characters or words, or explicit multi-agent long-form writing,
first call ${longFormGuidanceTool(serverName)} and follow its plan/claim/submit workflow.
This threshold concerns requested output, not input length. Load that protocol only on demand.
Before substantive writing, call ${tool('compile_generation_prompt')} with the task, style,
supplied context, and source_paths/reference_paths when available. Apply its instructions
while composing. For supplied-draft cleanup use ${tool('compile_humanize_prompt')}.
Use ${tool('compile_critique_prompt')} when the user wants advice rather than replacement text.
Keep factual evidence separate from voice references; never invent a citation, result,
personal experience, or source-backed detail. When necessary evidence is missing, narrow
the claim or identify missing input. Maintain fiction ledgers across chapters.
Before delivering substantial prose, use ${tool('lint_text')} as an editorial lead, not a
mandatory rewrite gate. Repair only evidenced defects. For rewrites check ${tool('verify_fidelity')}
and ${tool('verify_protected_content')}; unchanged numbers do not establish unchanged meaning.
Use focused audits when needed, not every audit on every paragraph. Long-form reviews
use the plan/claim/receipt/coverage tools. Do not claim naturalness or publish externally
solely because a lint score improved. Write or save content through DSH's normal output
tools when requested; publishing to an external destination needs that user's instruction.
